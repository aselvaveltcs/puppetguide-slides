Works on this deck have just started.

It's supposed to give practical, using, operative information to who has already some basic knowledge about Puppet:

- Language constructs
- How to manage typical tasks
- How to choose, use, integrate and write modules
- Puppet architecture and ecosystem components
- Hiera and data management
- PuppetDB
- Troubleshooting Puppet
