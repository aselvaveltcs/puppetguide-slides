# Code workflow management

  Puppet code should stay under a SCM (Git, Subversion, Mercurial... whatever )

  We must be able to test the code before committing to production

  Testing Puppet code syntax is easy, testing its effects is not

  Different testing methods for different purposes

  Different code workflow options

  Recommended: Couple Puppet environments with code branches [More info](http://puppetlabs.com/blog/git-workflow-and-puppet-environments/)
