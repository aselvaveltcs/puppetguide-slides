# What is Puppet?

Puppet is an Open Source **Configuration Management** tool.

It allows to define, with a declarative Domain Specific Language (**DSL**), what we want to configure and manage on an Operating System (OS): packages to install, services to start, files to configure and so on.

Puppet is also considered a framework for **Systems Automation** since it allows to automate the provisioning,  configuration and ongoing management of our servers, in a centrally managed way, using a language that abstracts the implementation on the underlying OS.

Puppet works on Linux, Unix (Solaris, AIX, \*BSD), MacOS, Windows ([Supported Platforms](http://docs.puppetlabs.com/guides/platforms.html)) and can be used also to configure network and storage devices or manage cloud resources.

It is developed by **[Puppet Labs](http://puppetlabs.com)** and is used by [many companies](http://puppetlabs.com/customers/companies/) with a number of managed systems than ranges from few dozens to several thousands.

Puppet Labs releases also [Puppet Enterprise](https://puppetlabs.com/puppet/puppet-enterprise) based on the [Open Source code base](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet) and oriented to enterprises that need official support and want Puppet infrastructure easier to setup and with better reporting and management features.


# Configuration Management

Configuration management tools allow to programmatically define how servers have to be configured. Their main benefits are:

- **Automation**: No need to manually configure systems
- **Reproducibility**: Setup once, repeat forever
- **Scale**: Done for one, use on many
- **Coherent** and consistent server setups
- **Aligned Environments** for devel, test, qa, prod nodes

Configuration management tools typically describe the systems setups via code or data (**Infrastructure as Code**), this involves a paradigm change in system administration:

- Systems are managed centrally and no more manually
- Code is versioned with a Source Control Management tool (**git** is the most used in Puppet world)
- Commits history shows the **history of change** on the infrastructure (who, what, when and why)
- Code can be tested before deployment in production
- Code has to be deployed

# Essential Puppet concepts

When approaching Puppet it's important to understand it's basic concepts and terminology. A complete official [glossary](http://docs.puppetlabs.com/references/glossary.html) is online, here we outline the most important Puppet concepts:

- A typical Puppet setup is based on a client-server architecture: the client is also called **agent** (or **agent node** or simply **node**), the server is called **master**
- The master provides a **catalog** that contains all the resources and their relationships that have to be applied to a given node.
- The catalog is based on the Puppet code written in **manifests** (files with **.pp** extension) parsed by the master
- In the code we declare **resources** that affect elements of the system (files, packages, services ...)
- Resources are grouped in **classes** which may expose **attributes** that affect their behavior.
- Classes and the configuration files that are shipped to nodes are organized in **modules**.
- On each node **facter** is executed to retrieve **facts**: piece of information about the node that are available as variables on the master during compilation.
